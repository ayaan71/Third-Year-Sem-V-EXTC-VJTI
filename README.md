# About Me
This is Vedant Athavale from TY BTech EXTC. Well, I guess there's hardly any need to introduce myself as </br> you must have got a fair idea from my GitHub profile. 
In brief, I am an amateur Web Developer who finds interest coding in React and Node for Web Development, </br> Python for ML and Business Inteliigence and C++ for basic DSA.

# Motive and Purpose:
As a senior to you all, I thought it might be great if I can help you all by sharing the study material</br> and save some of your time for actual studying. </br> 
As a student, I expect you all to study and solve assignments on your own and submit it accordingly. </br> Because this ready stuff wont help you during actual examination. 
What matters there is the actual hardwork and your self understanding of the subject. So, please refrain from plagiarism! </br> Professors in your Third Year are not to be taken for 
granted. They aren't like your SY Teachers. They will easily catch the plagiarism and the punishments might be </br> time taking for you if at all that professor is Rizwan Sir.
If at all anyone of you feel asking some doubt related to profs or internships or campus placements, feel </br> comfortable to message me on Whatsapp! 
</br> ## Happy Studying to you all!
